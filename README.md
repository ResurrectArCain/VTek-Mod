# Valid Blocks Mod ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ResurrectArCain/VTek-Mod# "Build Status")

<p>We don't have any reason why we created this it was just for fun and a way of teaching Amanda how to mod a game</p>

----------------

# Requirements:
<br>
<p>JDK 1.8.0</p>
<p>Eclipse (But can be changed read below on how)</p>
<br>
# Changing to IDEA
<br>
<code>gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies</code>
<p>The reason you want to refresh the dependencies is to make sure everything is correct and working so be sure to have that used</p>
<br>
<code>gradlew idea</code>
<p>after doing that the project should work and you can delete eclispe if you want or leave it in doesn't matter it will be removed later on</p>
